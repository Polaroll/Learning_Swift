# Overview

This software is a simple program designed to mimic a banking system. It includes being able to add, remove, and lookup accounts by ID. It also allows you to deposit and withdraw money for those accounts.

My purpose in writing this software was to create an environment where I could become familiar with Swift and understand how it works.

# Development Environment

I used GitHub to host this software and keep track of the updates I created for it. I also used Xcode as my IDE to create this program.

The language that I used was Swift, a simple and efficient programming language created by Apple.
